          The Irish Bouzouki is a popular stringed instrument used for accompaniment during traditional Irish sessions. Due to the Irish Bouzouki's scale length and overall pitch this tends to be in the form of chordal accompaniment however the instrument is also capable of performing melody lines. It is a relatively young instrument and a lot of its history & origin can be found on Wikipedia:

          Most people who discover the Irish Bouzouki for the first time do so having already played a different stringed instrument such as the guitar, mandolin or banjo. For guitar players, the most popular method of teaching is through tablature because of its simplicity and ability to get a person playing quickly. The lessons and resources on Irish-Trad.net are presented in tablature (TAB) alongside traditional sheet music to satisfy the absolute beginner and the musically trained.
