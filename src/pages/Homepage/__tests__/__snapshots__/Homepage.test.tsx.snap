        The Irish Bouzouki is a popular stringed instrument used for accompaniment during traditional Irish sessions. Due to the Irish Bouzouki's scale length and overall pitch this tends to be in the form of chordal accompaniment however the instrument is also capable of performing melody lines. It is a relatively young instrument and a lot of its history & origin can be found on Wikipedia:

        Most people who discover the Irish Bouzouki for the first time do so having already played a different stringed instrument such as the guitar, mandolin or banjo. For guitar players, the most popular method of teaching is through tablature because of its simplicity and ability to get a person playing quickly. The lessons and resources on Irish-Trad.net are presented in tablature (TAB) alongside traditional sheet music to satisfy the absolute beginner and the musically trained.

        The lessons section will provide information such as open chords, basic scales, barre and 'moveable' chords and additional information such as how to use accessories like a capo or how to change and tune Bouzouki strings. Music theory will also be used to reinforce an understanding of how chords and scales are construced.

        The chords section provides chord charts for the two most common tunings - GDAE and GDAD. The section covers basic triads such as Major and Minor and extended chords such as Major 7th, Minor 7th and Dominant 7th. The section will be expanded to include 'quick' moveable chords.
