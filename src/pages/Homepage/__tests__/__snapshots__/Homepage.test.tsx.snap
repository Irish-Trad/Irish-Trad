          Most people who decide to learn traditional Irish music for the first time do so having already played a different stringed instrument such as the guitar. For guitar players, the most popular method of teaching is through tablature because of the simplicity and ability to get a person playing quickly. The lessons and resources on Irish-Trad.net are presented in tablature (TAB) alongside traditional sheet music to satisfy the absolute beginner and the musically trained.
