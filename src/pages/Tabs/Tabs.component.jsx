      For those who are more familiar with Tablature than standard music
      notation or ABC notation I have taken a number of tunes from
      TheSession.org and converted them into both GDAE and GDAD .pdf's

      If you find these helpful in anyway you should consider visiting
      TheSession.org and even considering donating to the website. It has stood
      as a beacon for sharing and educating on traditional irish music for many
      years.
