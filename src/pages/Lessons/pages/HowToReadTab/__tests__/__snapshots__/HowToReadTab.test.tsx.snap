        Tablature is a form of music notation designed specifically for fretted instruments such as the Irish Bouzouki. Tablature is regarded as one of the quickest methods for teaching people how to play music. The word tablature is normally shortened to just TAB.

        To read tablature you have to picture that you are looking directly down on the strings of the instrument. Every string of the instrument is represented by a horizontal line. Instruments that have 4 strings (2 sets of 4) such as the Irish Bouzouki or Mandolin are represented by 4 horizontal lines.

        Figure 2 shows the direction that the strings are read. In this example every horizontal line is labelled with the name of the string in standard tuning.

        Numbers presented along the horizontal line instructs you of what fret to play. In Figure 3 the highlighted note is the number 0 (open string). As the horizontal line corresponds to the G string this means that you play an open G string to play this highlighted note.

        The highlighted section in Figure 5 shows how to play a note on every string at the same time. Doing this results in a chord. For this the G and D string are played open while the A string is fretted at 2nd fret and the E string is the 3rd fret. Strumming all the strings in a swift motion causes them to ring simultaneously. This produces a G Major chord.
