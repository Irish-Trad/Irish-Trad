        The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.

        Major Chords

        The basic Major chord consists of three notes. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3) and Perfect Fifth (5) intervals of each Major scale. To construct the C Major and E Major chord you begin with the scale consisting of the following notes:

      <p

        Extracting the three notes required from these scales means applying the following formula to each scale:

        Dominant 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The chord is also known as the Major Minor Seventh Chord as it borrows intervals from both the Major scale and the Minor scale. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor Seventh (b7). To construct the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th chord you begin with both scales consisting of the following notes:

      A theoretical description as to how the chords are constructed can be found above each diagram.
    </p>
    <p
      class="sc-ifAKCX jwmJJG"
    >
      The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.

      Dominant 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The chord is also known as the Major Minor Seventh Chord as it borrows intervals from both the Major scale and the Minor scale. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor Seventh (b7). To construct the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th chord you begin with both scales consisting of the following notes:

      Extracting the four notes required from these scales means applying the following formula to each scale:
