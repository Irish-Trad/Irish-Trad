          The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.

          The basic Major chord consists of three notes. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3) and Perfect Fifth (5) intervals of each Major scale. To construct the C Major and E Major chord you begin with the scale consisting of the following notes:

          Dominant 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The chord is also known as the Major Minor Seventh Chord as it borrows intervals from both the Major scale and the Minor scale. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor Seventh (b7). To construct the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th chord you begin with both scales consisting of the following notes:

        The patterns showcased aim to balance popularity of the shape, ease of play and inclusion of open strings. On other stringed instruments such as the guitar the root note of each chord is typically played on the lowest pitched or heaviest string but on the Irish Bouzouki this isn't always the case. When the third, fifth or seventh interval is played on the lowest pitched string these chords are considered in an inverted state. The chords still contain all the notes required to produce the overall tonality. In a traditional session other instruments that are pitched even lower than the Irish Bouzouki such as the double bass or bass guitar will fulfill the root notes role.

        Minor 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Minor Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor Seventh (7) intervals of each Minor scale. To construct the C Minor 7th and E Minor 7th chord you begin with the scale consisting of the following notes:

        Dominant 7th Chords are extended chords consisting of four notes. The chord is also known as the Major Minor Seventh Chord as it borrows intervals from both the Major scale and the Minor scale. The chord is formed using the Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5) and Minor Seventh (b7). To construct the C Dominant 7th and E Dominant 7th chord you begin with both scales consisting of the following notes:
